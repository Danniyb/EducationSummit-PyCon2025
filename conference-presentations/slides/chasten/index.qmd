## The Problem with Traditional Static Analysis

### Regular expression (regex) â‰  code understanding
- Fails on structural nuance
- Hard to maintain across formatting/styles 

## The Problem with Traditional Static Analysis

### AST tools are powerful but complex
- Require managing node types
- Difficult to prototype new rules

## Chasten
A Python program that uses XPATH expressions to find patterns in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Python program

## Features
- âœ¨ Easy-to-configure, automated analysis of a Python program's abstract syntax tree
- ðŸ“ƒ Flexible and easy-to-use YAML-based configuration file for describing analyses and checks
- ðŸš€ Configurable saving of analysis results in the JSON, CSV, or SQLite formats
- ðŸŒ„ Interactive results analysis through the use of a locally running datasette server

## Key Takeaways

- Learn how Chasten fits into a workflow for project-centric learning
- Create custom linting rules through a simple YAML configuration
- Practical examples of enforcing code standards on documentation and code
- Ways to analyze results through interactive dashboards with Datasette
- How to integrate Chasten into GitHub Classroom and GitHub Actions

## Introduction: The Problem with Static Analysis

- The limitations of regex for code analysis
- The complexity of traditional AST analysis frameworks
- What makes Chasten different: comparison to Ruff and Pylint

## Understanding AST Analysis

- What is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- XPath basics for programmers
- Using XPath to search the AST

## Getting Started with Chasten

- Installation and basic setup
- Understanding the configuration files
- Concrete examples of linting rules:
    - Finding missing docstrings
    - Detecting improper nesting of control structures
    - Enforcing type annotations
    - Identifying complex code patterns

## Analyzing Chasten's Results

- Saving and integrating results
- Using the Datasette dashboard
- Interpreting the findings

## Integration into Workflows

- Using Chasten in CI/CD pipelines
- Incorporating into development practices
- How to use Chasten for educational purposes
